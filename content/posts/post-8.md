Fresher Welcome Voting App is an interactive web platform designed to digitize university event elections. Built with React and Appwrite, the application enables students to cast votes for categories like "King" and "Queen" in a secure environment. A key technical feature is the implementation of real-time updates using Appwrite's subscriptions, allowing users to witness live results instantly. To ensure election integrity, I engineered strict authentication and vote-limiting protocols, all wrapped in a clean, intuitive UI that maximizes student engagement.
