HostelHub is a responsive web application designed to digitize the student residential experience. Built using React.js for dynamic interactivity and Bootstrap for a mobile-first, consistent UI, the platform provides students with a centralized dashboard for all their hostel needs. Users can easily track financial data, such as fine history and fund balances, and view important messages from the Warden. A key feature is the digital leave request system, which allows students to apply for days off directly through the app, streamlining communication and replacing manual paperwork with an efficient self-service workflow.
