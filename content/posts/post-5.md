Furniture Ecommerce Website is a full-stack retail platform engineered with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I architected a high-performance frontend using Zustand and TanStack Query for efficient state management and data fetching. The user interface features a clean, responsive design built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless shopping experience across devices. On the backend, I utilized Prisma ORM to manage database interactions and implemented secure role-based authentication. This security layer distinguishes between Admins—who have full control over inventory and CRUD operations—and Customers, who enjoy a smooth workflow for browsing categories, managing carts, and completing checkouts.
