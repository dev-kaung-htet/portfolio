Exam Management System is a robust full-stack application engineered using the "Vibe Coding" methodology on the Z.ai platform. By orchestrating AI agents to handle implementation details, I rapidly deployed a complex architecture featuring Next.js 15 (App Router) and TypeScript. The system leverages Next.js Server Actions and Zod for secure validation, while PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM manage intricate relational data between participants and groups. The UI, styled with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, utilizes TanStack Query for efficient fetching and Sonner for notifications—demonstrating how agentic workflows can accelerate the delivery of high-quality, production-grade software.
