Hostel Management System is a robust full-stack web application engineered to digitize and streamline residential administration. Built using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL, the platform replaces manual workflows with a secure, role-based ecosystem. I implemented JWT authentication to ensure strict data privacy across three distinct user roles: Registrars, Wardens, and Students.

The system empowers Registrars to manage accommodation records and generate PDF reports, while providing Wardens with tools to oversee student data, track funds, and issue fines. For the end-users, I designed an interactive Student Dashboard that facilitates self-service; students can track their financial standing and submit digital leave requests that are instantly routed to the Warden for approval. This architecture significantly enhances operational efficiency and closes the communication gap between staff and residents
